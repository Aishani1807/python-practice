# 📘 Python Learning Journey – Weeks 1 & 2

## 🗓️ Week 1: [July 8 – July 14, 2025]

My first week of Python practice laid a strong foundation in core programming concepts. Here's what I covered:

### ✅ Topics Covered
- **Modules & pip**  
  - Importing built-in and custom modules  
  - Installing packages using `pip`  

- **Comments**  
  - Writing single-line and multi-line comments for clarity  

- **Variables & Data Types**  
  - Declaring variables  
  - Understanding types like `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`  

- **Strings**  
  - String slicing, formatting, and methods like `.upper()`, `.find()`, etc.  

- **Lists & Tuples**  
  - Creating, accessing, and manipulating list/tuple elements  
  - Difference between mutable (lists) and immutable (tuples) sequences
